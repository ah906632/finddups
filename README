This is a command line Java app to find duplicate files on your computer.

To use it, you need Git, Java, and Maven.

git clone https://github.com/caluml/finddups
mvn clean install
java -jar ~/.m2/repository/finddups/finddups/0.0.1-SNAPSHOT/finddups-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar /home/ 1000000

First, it recurses the given directory, building a list of files.
Then, it looks for files which have identically sized files.
It then reads those identically sized files, comparing them byte for byte until it finds a byte that doesn't match, or it reaches the end of the file.

I chose not to use any kind of hashing or CRC system, as that would require reading the entire file, which would be less efficient if a byte near the beginning was different.

TODO: Time generating two MD5s of two identical files and compare them, with comparing those two files byte by byte.

The app outputs its errors to stderr, and its results to stdout as it goes.

Any suggestions/comments to my github username at gmail.com
